## 4.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 51f6a45: Hardened realtime authorization and internal communication architecture across the platform. Refactored the socket server into a transport-only layer using secure internal web authorization bridges, centralized conversation/task ACL enforcement, server-resolved participant fan-out, and mandatory INTERNAL_SECRET validation. Added shared authorization services for REST and socket flows, removed client-trusted recipient authorization paths, restricted unsafe task status mutations, and improved overall security consistency for realtime messaging and task execution.
