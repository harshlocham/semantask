# @semantask/socket

## 3.0.4

### Patch Changes

- 51f6a45: Hardened realtime authorization and internal communication architecture across the platform. Refactored the socket server into a transport-only layer using secure internal web authorization bridges, centralized conversation/task ACL enforcement, server-resolved participant fan-out, and mandatory INTERNAL_SECRET validation. Added shared authorization services for REST and socket flows, removed client-trusted recipient authorization paths, restricted unsafe task status mutations, and improved overall security consistency for realtime messaging and task execution.

## 3.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 5a2cba8: - Socket: register message:send handlers; broadcast online status on connect; remove duplicate join/leave handlers
  - Web: connect socket after login/register without reload; stop disconnecting on tab visibility changes
  - Mobile: reconnect on app foreground instead of disconnecting in background
  - Task worker: use @semantask/services package imports so production start resolves modules correctly
  - Root: Next 15.5.18 override, uuid 14, ESLint config baseDirectory for apps/web
