### Minor Changes

  - Added explicit build scripts/config for shared packages (auth, db, services, redis, types) to emit dist artifacts consistently.
  - Improved repository cleanup scripts with safer artifact cleanup and full-reset options.
  - Updated Turbo build outputs for better Next.js build caching behavior.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [3215a80]
  - @chat/types@1.1.0

## 1.0.3

### Patch Changes

- 86f8cfe: Refactor CI/CD to use Changesets-native package tags for deployment

  - Removed root `v*` tag creation logic from release workflow
  - Updated deploy workflow to trigger on Changesets tags (`@chat/services@*`)
  - Implemented strict tag parsing and validation
  - Added package-specific deployment gating
  - Improved Docker tagging and metadata extraction
  - Enforced PAT usage for reliable workflow chaining

- Updated dependencies [86f8cfe]
  - @chat/types@1.0.3

## 1.0.2

### Patch Changes

- 86f8cfe: Fix release workflow to create root version tags for deploy trigger

  - **release.yml**: Add step to create root repository version tag (v\*) based on highest package version
  - **deploy.yml compatibility**: Root v\* tags now enable proper deployment workflow triggering
  - This resolves the issue where release workflow created only package-scoped tags but deploy workflow needed root tags

- Updated dependencies [86f8cfe]
  - @chat/types@1.0.2

## 1.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 3b307d2: Fix CI/CD release and deployment pipeline configuration

  - **release.yml**: Fix publish step to actually create git tags using `npx changeset tag` instead of echo fallback
  - **release.yml**: Add robust token fallback (`CHANGESETS_GITHUB_TOKEN || GITHUB_TOKEN`) for private repo releases
  - **deploy.yml**: Relax actor gate to allow repository owner to trigger deployments from token-based releases
  - **deploy.yml**: Add comprehensive deployment provenance validation (semver format, commit ancestry, GitHub Release verification)
  - **deploy.yml**: Add timeout configurations and improve error handling for staging/production builds

  These fixes ensure the automated release pipeline correctly creates version tags and the deployment workflow is properly triggered, enabling end-to-end CI/CD automation for the monorepo.

- Updated dependencies [3b307d2]
  - @chat/types@1.0.1
